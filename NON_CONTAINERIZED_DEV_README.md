# Developing on SCP without a docker container

Developing on SCP without a Docker container, while less robust, opens up some faster development paradigms, including live css/js reloading, faster build times, and byebug debugging in rails.

## SETUP

1.  Run ruby -v to ensure Ruby 2.5.7 is installed on your local machine.  If not,  install rvm, then rvm install 2.5.7, then rvm use 2.5.7.
2.  Run bundler -v to ensure Bundler is installed.  If not,  gem install bundler.
3.  cd to where you have the single_cell_portal_core Git repo checked out.
4.  Run `bundle install`
5.  Run `yarn install`
6.  Run `ruby rails_local_setup.rb $BROAD_USERNAME`, where $BROAD_USERNAME is a something like eweitz
7.  Run the source command the script outputs
8.  Run `rails s`
9.  (optional, for live reload) In another tab, run bin/webpack-dev-server
10. (needed if you are working on functionality that involves delayed jobs).
    * In another terminal, run the source command output in step 7
    * run `rails jobs:work`
10.  You're all set!  You can now go to localhost:3000 and see the website.


## KNOWN ISSUES
0. Developing outside the docker container inherently runs more risk that your code will not work in the docker environment in staging/production.  BE CAREFUL.  If your changes are non-trivial, confirm your changes work in the containerized deploy before committing (ESPECIALLY changes involving package.json and/or the Gemfile)
1. You may experience difficulty toggling back and forth between containerized and non-containerized deployment, as node-sass bindings are OS-specific.  If you see an error like 'No matching version of node-sass found'
   * if this error occurs when trying to deploy in the container, fix it by deleting the `node-modules/node-sass` folder, and then rerunning the load_env_secrets process
   * if the error is when you're trying to run locally, fix it by running `npm rebuild node-sass`
